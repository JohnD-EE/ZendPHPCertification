### Web Features
It's feasible to use PHP in non-web contexts e.g. Command Line Scripting or even for writing desktop apps ([What can PHP do?](http://php.net/manual/en/intro-whatcando.php)).
According to the Davey Shafey book it is used in Point of Sale (POS) Systems, Quality Assurance systems and even jukeboxes.
However it is primarily used for Web Programming.
